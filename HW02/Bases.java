 * CS 2110 Spring 2017 HW2
 * Part 2 - Coding with bases
 *
 * @author Pranshav Thakkar
 *
 * Global rules for this file:
 * - You may not use more than 2 conditionals per method. Conditionals are
 *   if-statements, if-else statements, or ternary expressions. The else block
 *   associated with an if-statement does not count toward this sum.
 * - You may not use more than 2 looping constructs per method. Looping
 *   constructs include for loops, while loops and do-while loops.
 * - You may not use nested loops.
 * - You may not declare any file-level variables.
 * - You may not declare any objects, other than String in select methods.
 * - You may not use switch statements.
 * - You may not use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
 * - You may not write any helper methods, or call any other method from this or
 *   another file to implement any method.
 * - The only Java API methods you are allowed to invoke are:
 *     String.length()
 *     String.charAt()
 * - You may not invoke the above methods from string literals.
 *     Example: "12345".length()
 * - When concatenating numbers with Strings, you may only do so if the number
 *   is a single digit.
 *
 * Method-specific rules for this file:
 * - You may not use multiplication, division or modulus in any method, EXCEPT
 *   decimalStringToInt.
 * - You may declare exactly one String variable each in intToBinaryString and
 *   and intToHexString.
